### [Angular's](https://github.com/topics/angular) introductory [tutorial](https://angular.io/start)

"This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Angular by walking you through building an e-commerce site with a catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form.

To help you get started right away, this tutorial uses a ready-made application that you can examine and modify interactively on StackBlitz —without having to set up a local work environment. StackBlitz is a browser-based development environment where you can create, save, and share projects using a variety of technologies."
